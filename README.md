## Abstract
In recent years, the clandestine incorporation of malevolent entities, colloquially termed as hardware Trojans (HT), within the Integrated Circuit (IC) fabrication trajectory has manifested pronounced security implications. Such Hardware Trojans are meticulously designed to either alter the predefined functionalities, deviate from the established specifications, diminish performance, compromise reliability, or surreptitiously siphon sensitive data during real-time operations. Given the burgeoning nature of this threat landscape, myriad Trojan detection methodologies have emerged. Yet, a conspicuous gap persists in terms of devising efficient detection paradigms specifically tailored for the critical design juncture. To address this lacuna, this paper presents an HT-PRED framework that includes Trojan attribute datasets and an HT detection model. The proposed framework underscores the genesis of the dataset—a comprehensive assemblage of Trojan attributes distilled from gate-level netlists. Significantly, this dataset amalgamates functional and structural features, thus laying a robust foundation for the evolution of holistic Trojan detection schema. Harnessing this dataset’s potency, we applied diverse machine learning and deep learning algorithms to discern the covert insertion of Trojans at the design inception. Notably, our most efficacious model, a Deep Neural Network, manifested an accuracy pinnacle of 98.95%. This was closely rivaled by a precision of 98.94% as evinced by a J48 Decision Tree construct. To translate this research into tangible utility, we have instantiated these algorithmic models into a stand-alone and a web-accessible interface envisaged for both the academic diaspora and industrial conglomerates
